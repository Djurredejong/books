# Short description
Ex-con Shadow finds employment by the Norse-God-in-America Wednesday (Odin). Wednesday is rousing the old gods to wage war on the "new gods" (such as media, highway, creditcard). After several road trip like adventures, the battle between the gods turns out to be a setup plan of Odin to kill as many gods as possible to feed his own status. Shadow manages to stop this plan, without a lot of effort.
